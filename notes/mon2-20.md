Looking at linkFL.h, we have "modularity" 

what is a "void*" means that it returns a pointer. 
Since we are inside the link class, we know it is 
going to return a link* at runtime.





The delte operator say we want to put a pointer at the
head of the list.


The freelist here is effectively a linked list.

"hiding in linkFL.h is the idea of a stack" 

Looking at dlinkDL.h:
we literally do the obvious thing 
of creating a "prev" attribute.


We are essentially making the llist.h better. since 
we are making prev faster, but we have twice as 
many pointers. This is simply a factor a two, so it's 
not a big deal.


insert() will need to be changed for dll.

(())()
every time you hit open paren, push on to stack, close paaren pop

stack is the stack of open parens that have not yeet been matched by a closed paren

)( in-balanced => broken

# Stacks & Queues

These are linear, so group them with list. 
stack and queues just have limited functionality (intentionally)
