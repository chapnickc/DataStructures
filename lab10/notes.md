## Serialization & Deserialization
Take some class and convert it to bunch of bytes

Write a method that takes the private data and convertes it 
to a string of bytes, that's seriaization.

Going the other way is deserialization

Some standard formats:
- XML
- JSON
- RDF



```c++
class a:{

private:
public:
}
``
